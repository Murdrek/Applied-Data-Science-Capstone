### 🧾 Executive Summary: Modules 1–4  
**Reproducible Data Science for Institutional and Territorial Impact**

This series of labs documents a strategic, modular approach to applied data science, focused on traceability, onboarding, and institutional storytelling. Across four interconnected modules, the work reconstructs workflows, validates outputs, and builds bilingual, auditable dashboards for stakeholder engagement.

---

### 📦 Module 1: Data Reconstruction & Validation  
**Objective:** Recover and defend lost analytical work through reproducible coding and documentation.

- Rebuilt SQL queries and EDA pipelines with strategic comments and Markdown-ready blocks  
- Structured hierarchical folders linking datasets to source notebooks for auditability  
- Created bilingual README templates and onboarding guides for institutional reuse  

---

### 📊 Module 2: Visual Analytics & Dashboarding  
**Objective:** Transform technical outputs into interactive, stakeholder-facing visualizations.

- Designed modular dashboards using Plotly Dash and Folium  
- Integrated narrative mapping and spatial traceability across infrastructure nodes  
- Documented each visualization with bilingual tooltips, strategic labels, and institutional rationale  

---

### 🌐 Module 3: Territorial Connectivity & Strategic Mapping  
**Objective:** Map geospatial relationships between coastal, terrestrial, and institutional nodes.

- Calculated geodesic distances between highways, launch sites, coastal zones, and urban centers  
- Visualized connections with labeled lines and modular Folium maps  
- Synthesized findings into defendable narratives for planning, resilience, and onboarding  

---

### 📐 Module 4: Classification Modeling & Institutional Defense  
**Objective:** Predict rocket landing outcomes using supervised learning, selecting the most defendable model for institutional reporting.

- Explored launch data with strategic EDA and feature engineering  
- Trained and compared classifiers: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN  
- Selected SVM as the most defendable model based on accuracy, interpretability, and reproducibility  
- Documented modeling pipeline with bilingual comments, validation metrics, and onboarding-ready notebooks  
- Prepared institutional report linking model outputs to stakeholder narratives and decision-making contexts
